**Setting the stage: Genomic Analysis of Exons and SNPs**
---
- **Locate Exons**

First I get some data into my history. Then I upload files from the PC computer, though Galaxy can also fetch data directly from external sources, for example University of California Santa Cruiz Genomics Institute (UCSC). UCSC has exon locations for humans and I used Galaxy to import the data for chromosome 22, directly from the UCSC table browser.

- **Find exons with the most SNPs**
- **Count the number of SNPs per exon**
- **Sort the exons by SNPs count**
- **Select top five exons**
- **Recover exon info**
- **Display data in UCSC genome browser**
