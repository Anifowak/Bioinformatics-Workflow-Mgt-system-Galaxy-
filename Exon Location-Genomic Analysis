# **Setting the stage: Exons and SNPs Get your workspace ready**
Genomic Analysis

Locate Exons
First I get some data into our history. We upload files from the PC computer, or Galaxy can also fetch data directly from external sources. UCSC has exon locations for humans and used Galaxy to import the data for chromosome 22, directly from the UCSC table browser.

Find exons with the most SNPs
Count the number of SNPs per exon
Sort the exons by SNPs count
Select top five exons
Recover exon info
Display data in University of California Santa Cruiz Genomics Institute (UCSC) genome browser
